### **What is `react-router-dom`?**

>  **`react-router-dom`** is a **library** for React that lets you build **multi-page navigation** in your React app — without refreshing the whole page.

It handles **routing** in **React web applications**. Think of it as the brain that controls **what to show** based on the **URL path**.

### Why You Need It

> By default, React is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** — it only loads **one HTML file**. But real apps (like your LMS) need different **"pages"**: Home, Login, Courses, etc.  
> That's where `react-router-dom` comes in — it lets you map **URLs to components**.
