###  **What is Routing in Frontend?**

>  **Routing** in the frontend is the process of **navigating between different pages or views** of a web application **without reloading the whole page**.

---

### In Simpler Words:

> Think of routing as a way for your app to **switch between screens** — like going from the **Home page** to a **Courses page** or a **Profile page** — while staying on the same website without refreshing everything.

---

###  Example (React App):

Imagine you're building an LMS:

| Route (URL) | What it shows       |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| `/`         | Home page           |
| `/courses`  | List of all courses |
| `/login`    | Login form          |
| `/profile`  | User profile        |

###  Benefits of Frontend Routing:

- **Faster navigation** between pages (no full reloads)
    
- **Better user experience**
    
- Helps create **Single Page Applications (SPA)**
