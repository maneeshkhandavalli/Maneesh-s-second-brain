 **Midnight Labs** is a student-led freelancing agency started by four curious minds who share a passion for building cool things on the web. While we’re still students, we’re deeply committed to learning and delivering specializing in **full-stack web development** and **modern web design**.
  
 We may not have years of experience yet, but what we bring to the table is **fresh perspective**, **strong teamwork**, and a willingness to push ourselves on every project. Midnight Labs is where we explore, build, and grow one project at a time.
